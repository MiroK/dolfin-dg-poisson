# The bilinear form a(u, v) and linear form L(v) for
# Poisson's equation in a discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
# formulation.
#
# Compile this form with FFC: ffc -l dolfin Poisson.ufl

# Elements
element = FiniteElement("Discontinuous Lagrange", triangle, 1)

# Trial and test functions
u = TrialFunction(element)
v = TestFunction(element)

# Source term, Dirichlet term, Neumann term
f = Coefficient(element)
u0 = Coefficient(element)
g = Coefficient(element)

# Normal component, cell size and right-hand side
h = 2.0*triangle.circumradius
h_avg = (h('+') + h('-'))/2
n = element.cell().n

# Parameters
alpha = 4.0
gamma = 8.0

# Bilinear form
a = dot(grad(v), grad(u))*dx \
   - dot(avg(grad(v)), jump(u, n))*dS \
   - dot(jump(v, n), avg(grad(u)))*dS \
   + alpha/h_avg*dot(jump(v, n), jump(u, n))*dS \
   - dot(grad(v), u*n)*ds(1) \
   - dot(v*n, grad(u))*ds(1) \
   + gamma/h*v*u*ds(1)

# Linear form
L = v*f*dx - u0*dot(grad(v), n)*ds(1) + gamma/h*u0*v*ds(1) + g*v*ds(2)
